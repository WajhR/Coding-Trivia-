## Description

The coding Trivia was created to help the students in their journey to become a full-stack web developer. It will help the students assess their knowledge of Javascript. The trivia is a timed coding app with multiple-choice questions.  It taught me how to build dynamic app using HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
